**Project Details**
1. **Topic and Data Collection**
- Topic: Data analysis of national high school exam scores in 2019 and 2020.
- Data Source: [BeeCost](https://github.com/beecost/bee-university/tree/master/output_data/crawler/common)

2. **What have been done in this project?**
- Data Explorations.
- Visualize score spectrum.
- Show score in range point.
- Build model to predict score of subject by another subjects in group of that subject.

3. **To Solve Problems**
- Looking at the score spectrum, we can understand the student's learning situation of each year as well as the easy / difficult level of the high school exam that year. Partially assess the quality of education as well as the quality of students.
The score spectrum also shows that this year's candidates are strong in which exams. In addition, through the score spectrum, we will also be able to assess whether that year's exam is standardized or not.
Universities base on the score spectrum to develop appropriate benchmarks.
- Give interpretation.
